An IDE written in an IDE. How much better can it get?

Hey, Jarmo. If you're reading this (which I hope you aren't), well... basically i'm not finished with the project yet. ðŸ˜¬
i'm really sorry, just the exam week has been a wild ride.
give me until sat evening, i'll be def done by then.
for now on, the code works as a semi-decent notepad, but i want it to be able to run java code soo ye...
